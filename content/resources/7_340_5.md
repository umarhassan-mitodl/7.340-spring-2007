description: This resource contains lecture notes on the classical pathway of endogenous
  antigen presentation, how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can trigger down-regulation
  of MHC class I at the cell surface and hide from T cell killing, how an HCMV gene
  product was found to target MHC class I for degradation in the cytosol, and the
  cellular machinery used by the virus to reach its goal.
