description: To ensure their own survival, viruses, bacteria, and parasites have devised
  ways to evade the immune surveillance of their respective host. By looking at the
  specific ways by which these microbes defeat the immune system and the molecular
  mechanisms that are under attack, the course aims to explore both host-pathogen
  interaction as well as gain insight into how the immune system operates when faced
  with such a challenge. (Image by Dr. G. Grotenbreg.)
