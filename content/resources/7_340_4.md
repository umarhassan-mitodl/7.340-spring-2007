description: This resource contains lecture notes on how proteins that are no longer
  needed or do not properly function are destroyed by the proteasome by the post-translational
  attachment of ubiquitin, how bugs have developed clever ways to remove the ubiquitin
  tag from these essential proteins with deubiquinating enzymes (DUBs), and tools
  that have been developed recently for the identification of DUBs and their possible
  role in immune evasion by Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the bacterial pathogen
  Yersinia.
