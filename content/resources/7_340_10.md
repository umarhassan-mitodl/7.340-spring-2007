description: This resource contains lecture notes on the capacity of Cationic antimicrobial
  peptides to nonspecifically disrupt membrane integrity in a variety of microorganisms,
  how Salmonella typhimurium senses the presence of CAPs and reacts by initiating
  a signal-transduction cascade that leads to transcription of virulence gene-products
  to promote bacterial infection, and how Bordetella bronchiseptica can attenuate
  CAP gene expression, thus effecting evasion of the innate immune system.
