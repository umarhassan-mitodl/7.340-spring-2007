description: This resource contains lecture notes on how cytokines are short-lived
  small molecules that can influence the outcome of an immune response by activating
  certain types of cells or act as chemoattractants to direct immune cells to a site
  of infection, how viruses can use the cytokine system to their advantage with two
  different strategies, how Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes virus secrete chemokine-like
  molecules that can counteract the effect of endogenous cytokines and trick our immune
  cells into modifying their response, and how HIV uses a chemokine receptor to anchor
  itself and eventually penetrate the host cell.
