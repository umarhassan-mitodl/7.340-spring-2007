description: 'This resource contains lecture notes on how infection of CD4+ T cells
  with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to the demise of the immune system
  and the clinical manifestation of AIDS, the role of the HIV-derived nef gene, how
  the nef gene product is shown to interact with another element of the MHC class
  II Ag presentation pathway: The Invariant Chain, and how HIV could benefit from
  adapting intracellular trafficking of these molecules through Nef.'
