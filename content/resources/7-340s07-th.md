  caption: To ensure their own survival, viruses, bacteria, and parasites have devised
    ways to evade the immune surveillance of their respective host. By looking at
    the specific ways by which these microbes defeat the immune system and the molecular
    mechanisms that are under attack, the course aims to explore both host-pathogen
    interaction as well as gain insight into how the immune system operates when faced
    with such a challenge. (Image courtesy of Dr. G. Grotenbreg.)
